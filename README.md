# PneumoniaConvNNet
A Convolutional Neural Network for Classifying Pediatric Chest X-rays Into Pneumonia vs Normal Implemented in PyTorch.
## Dataset 
The Dataset used to train and test this model was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia, with only slight modifications being done on it (i.e. equalizing the pneumonia vs normal chest xrays for training to avoid problems with learning)
